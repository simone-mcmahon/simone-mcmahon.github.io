          <p>While HTML and CSS are two very different programming languages, both need each other to work. HTML is your content on the page. Your words, your links, 
             your images etc. Think of it like the rooms in a house. Its the walls, the ceiling and windows that you see. When you first build a house (or website) 
             these things look plain, barebone so to speak. This is where CSS comes in. CSS tells the HTML what to look like. It sets sizes of images, fonts, colours 
             and much, much more. In regards to our analogy of the house, CSS is like your interior design. Its the paint on your walls, the curtains you hang or ugly
            lamp your aunt gave you last christmas.

        <h2>Control Flow and Loops</h2>

     <div class="text">
         <p>Control flow is the order or sequence in which parts of your code or programme activate. A loop is exactly as the name suggests. Where a programme completes 
             a task over and over untill is reaches the condition that it has been told to stop at, eg: a set amount of times.
         </p>

           <p> A great example of control flow in real life is making a coffee. There is a process to this. You first need to decide if you want a coffee. Then you need to go to the kitchen.
               You then go through the process of gringing your beans, tamping your shout, loading it in the machine. You extract your shot and then decide if you want milk (Yes? No?).
               Are you having sugar? Once you are done you then drink the coffee. The loop then begins again, as your crippling caffiene addiction kicks in and your drag yourself to the 
               kitchen for another hit. And again and again until you have had the number you permit yourself a day or until you have a severe case of the coffee jitters and can't 
               type (wait, is this just me?).

    <div class="text">
        <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) shows how different parts of your code are related to each other. Similar to a family tree, elemnts of code follow a
            structure of parent-child-sibling.
