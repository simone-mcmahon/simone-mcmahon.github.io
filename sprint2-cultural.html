          <h1>Learning Reflections</h1>
         
          <h2>Your Blog</h2>
            
          <p><u>Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple terms?</u>u></p>
            <p>In this exercise we used HTML and CSS to set up a blog to record our learning reflections and our technical proficiency.
             </p>

          <p><u>Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?</u></p>
             <P>I managed to achieve most of the the learning conpetencies although there are a couple that i will be going over again to make sure I really understand
                 them. I feel like I was much better at sticking to timeboxes this week when I really needed to.
             </p>


          <h2>Learn HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p><u>What resources did you use during this challenge? Why did you choose those ones?</u></p>
        <p>I chose to use the Udacity resourses for this challange. I really liked the format of diagrams and videos
            they used when we leant about version control and thought that I would stick with something I knew would work for me.
        </p>   

        <p><u>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</u></p>
        <p>I struggled with mananging my time around the kids this week. I found catching up late at night was really helpful and I feel like I work quite well at night,
            when everyone is in bed and the house is quiet.
        </p>

        <p><u>What are of you proud of from during this challenge?</u></p>
        <p>I am really proud of not giving up when I realised there was so much I didnt know even after going through the Udacity courses. Having to research and
            teach myself how to make certain things was quite daunting but extreamly rewarding once I figured things out. </em></p>

        <p><u>Did you keep within the timebox suggestions?</u></p>
        <p>I did. I feel like they were much more generous this sprint.</p>

        <p><u>How much faster could you do it if you started from the beginning again, right now?</u></p>
         <p>I think I would definatly be faster, I know where to look for help now. I think I would solve problems a little faster.</p>
    
         <h2>Add HTML and CSS to your Blog Challenge</h2>
         <p><u>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.</u></p>
        <div class="comebacktothis"><p>I need to come back to this question</p></div>
    
      <p><u>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them? </u></p>
     <p>I guess like every week the obsticle is trying to organise study around my family. Planning helps a lot but there are always
         things that pop up unexpectidly.
     </p>

    <p><u>Any moments of surprise or joy?</u></p>
    <p>Getting my links to work was really satisfying.Ithought I was going to struggle with that but it was surprisingly easy.</p>
   
   <p><u>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</u></p>
   <p>HTML would be a cat, they like boxes. CSS, probably something fussy and really pretty like a Lilac-breasted roller. </p>
