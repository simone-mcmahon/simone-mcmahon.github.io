<p>Emotional intelligence is a persons ability to understand, process and communicate about their own and others emotions. This is different from IQ which only measures
    a persons intelligence potential. Emotions are incredibly important in forming and managing relationships. Without emotional intelligence a person would find it difficult
    to build healthy relationships inside and outside of the workplace. </p>

    <p>You can train your brain to have better emotional intelligence just like you can train to have a better IQ.</p>
    <p>There are many ways to do this. Three of the most popular ways are meditation/mindfulness, conscious listening and journaling.</p>

<p>Mindfulness and meditation has been shown to have a huge range of benefits from helping with depression to improving attention. Whne practisong mindfulness you 
    foucus on your thoughts, paying attention to what you are thinking, acknowleging what you are thinking and then simply moving on, allowing your mind to be still
    if you can, and if not, moving on to the next thought without judgement. 
</p>
<p>Conscious listening (otherwise known as listening and looping) is where you take turns talking for short periods of time with another person. Instead of a normal 
    conversation where you may feel inclined to butt in, or add to what they are saying, you must remain silent for the duration of the set time the other person is talking.
    Once they have finished you then relay to them what they have said to you in your own words allowing them to add in any changed they feel is nessessary to help make the 
    point they are making more clear. This technique is particularily helpful as it allows you to focus completly on what is being said, rather than trying to complete the others
    dialogue or problem solve, meaning they have your undivided attention. </p>

<p>Lastly, we have journaling. This is generally a private excersise which allows for you to brain dump. A great way to do this is with a prompt and a set time. You start 
    writing and dont stop until the time is up. Just write everything that comes into your mind. This can be great for exploring emotions that are attatched to
experiences from your day, reflecting on learning and helping to verbalise feelings. </p>
