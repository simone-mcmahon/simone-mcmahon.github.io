            <p> 
                The last 5 weeks have been some of the most challanging I've experienced in my learning journey to date. Looking back over my time in foundations, 
                Its very clear to me that I have learnt so much about not only HTML, CSS and JavaScript but also about myself. I have learnt that asking for help when you need it
                is ok, in fact its really important. Before starting foundations I really struggled to ask for help as I consider myself to be quite independant. 
                I was inclined to just grind away at something until I got it to work or I was so frustrated that I couldnt think straight. However, now I feel like I have the confidence
                to reach out (to my facilitator and my peers) and ask for help when I become really stuck, without beating myself up about it, which feels really big for me. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                A really important skill Ive learnt (and still working on) is being kinder to myself. It was really easy at the beggining to beat myself up for not knowing
                how to do something. In the last couple of weeks Ive tried very hard to be more mindful of the way I speak to myself, which has helped me to not get stuck in this loop of
                feeling like I'll never be smart enough to understand any of this, because in fact thats not correct. I understand much more than I think I do a lot of the time, and realising
                that was a huge boost to my confidence.
            </p>

            <p>
                The last thing Ive learnt about myself is that I'm determined. I'm so proud of myself for not giving up when things got tough. It wpuld hae been so easy to stop and say " I quit",
                but I haven't. Its been really nice to see that I can stick with something and keep perservering even when I'm really struggling. 
            </p>

            <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
                <p>
                    I think emotional intelligence is incredibly important in both learning and programming, infact you could say its important in life in general.
                    Self awearness is what helps you manage the way that you interact with the world around you. Its how you manage your own stress, how you manage conflict with
                    others, and how you manage your emotions and the effects that they have on the people around you. This is especially imporatnt when you 
                    are interacting with people
                    in social situations. Empathy also comes into play here. Understanding how others are feeling helps us to respond to a situation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Again, I believe that values are important not just in a learning or programming environment but are generally important in all areas of your life.
                    Values are what shape you as the person you are. They are what keeps you going whan you face difficult situations or decisions. They are what motivate you to
                    keep striving to reach the goals that you set. Values are quite often your reason fo doing something. Without them you dont really have a reason for doing anything.

            <h2>Some deep thoughts about the core material</h2>
             <div class="catimg">

                 alt="" height=200px width=350px>
            </div>

                <p>
                    All through foundations I have been really suprised by the amount of core material.
                    Its been really nice to break up the very intense tech with material that I find much more
                    intuitive by comparison. I like that the core material has made me pause and think, while not being 
                    too challenging, although I was suprised with how much I struggled with my fixed mindset.
                </p>

                <p>I think it great the EDA spends so much time focusing on core learning. It helps you understand
                   so much bout the way that you learn, which you can then use to become a better learner. I definatley 
                   believe the time I have spent on the core material has been beneficial and helped me achieve what I have in the five weeks
                   I have been here.
