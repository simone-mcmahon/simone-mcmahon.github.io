    <h1>What is the difference between Margins, Borders, and Padding?</h1>
  
    <div class="boxmodel">

      alt="The box model" height=250px width=500px>.
  </div> 
  <p>Imagine that your HTML is a box, filled with many other smaller boxes.
  Each of these smaller boxes is an element. Without borders, padding and margins (and CSS)
  you would have a lot of trouble telling when one element ends and the next begins.
  </p> 

  <h2>Margins:</h2>
  <div class="marginsimg">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/rix456r.png" 
    alt="Margins" height=150px width=250px>.
</div> 
  <p> 
  Margins define the space outside of an HTML element, essentially the space around your boxes.
  Rather than having your elemnts right up next to one another, margins allow you to separate your elements
  and space your content out. You set the margin for all four sides of the element as shown above, 
  using top, bottom, left and right.
  </p>

  <h2>Borders:</h2>
  <div class="bordersimg">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tsxVVFM.png" 
    alt="Borders" height=150px width=250px>.
</div> 
  <p>
   Borders sit around an element. Think of them like a frame or a fence. They can be styled in many different ways
   and help keep content contained tidily. You can assign borders many properties; including width,
   colour, and style as shown in the above image.
  </p>

    <h2>Padding:</h2>
    <div class="paddingimg">
      <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MvjMnez.png" 
      alt="Padding" height=150px width=250px>.
  </div> 
  <p>
    Padding defines the space around your content, inside of any border. The padding is set much like the margin, usin the properties
    top, bottom, left and right as shown above.
