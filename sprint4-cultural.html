          <p>Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to change. Despite what you may have been told, you can in fact, teach an old dog new tricks.
            The brain is an amazing organ that is constantly changing and reshaping and this is heavily influenced by your day to day life. When you practise a task, 
            your neural pathways are strengthened by the repitition, growing thicker and closer together, meaning the task becomes hardwired in your brain . Eventually this will make the task seem like second nature. This works
            the same in reverse. If the pathways arent being used your brain will begin to "prune" them. This really is a case of "use it or loose it" in action.
          </p>
            <p>Understanding neuroplasticity and how it shapes your brain is hugly beneficial. It has been shown to help with recovery from brain injuries and strokes,
                 assisting in treatment of depession and enhanceing your learning and memory skills and much more.
              </p>
        <p>Just like you can train train the muscles in your body, you can also train your brain to be stronger. You can do this by:
          </p>
          <ul>

              <li>Meditate</li>
              <li>Move your body. Excercise regularily, working your body works your brain</li>
              <li>Set SMART goals</li>           
              <li>Work towards your goal everyday, but in smaller amounts, rather than cramming large amounts of practise in sporadically. <strong>Make it routine</strong></li>
