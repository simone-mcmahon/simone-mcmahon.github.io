            <h1>Learning Reflections</h1>
            <h2>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h2>
            <p>This is something I am still not 100% certain on. I know that I want to do something creative and something that I enjoy.
               </p>
            <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
            <p>More confidence in my own abilities. I would really like to work onknowing when to step away from problems and take a break rather then just grinding it out.
                I'd also like to work on creating boundaries and not be in work mode all the time. </p>
            <h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h2>
            <p>One of my strengths would be that I'm a hard worker. Once I start something I am always keen to finish it, although this can be a limitation sometimes as I struggle
                to know when to take a break or stop. </p>
            <h2>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. 
                This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely 
                with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h2>
            <p>To manage the workload of EDA I will plan out my weeks in advance, making myself awear of the amount of time I will need. I then block out any
                    chunks of time I have to study and work hard to make sure I stick to them.
                </p>
            <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h2>
            <p>I have a great problem solving process put in place which seems to be working so far. However If for some reason It doesnt work I will first try finding a 
                    solution on the internet. My next option would be to reach out to the EDA slack channels and then lastly my facilitator.
                </p>
            <h2>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h2>
            <p>...</p>
            <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. 
                For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.</h2>
            <p>...</p>
